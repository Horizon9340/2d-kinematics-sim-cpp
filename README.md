# 2d-kinematics-sim-cpp
This repo documents my journey of learning how to code in C++, and how to create a basic 2D kinematics simulation of projectile motion in C++.

## The Learning Process
Before making any simulations, I first need to learn how to code in C++, as well as the behavior, syntax, and how to compile code.
[learn](learn/): This folder contains three files where I learned the basics of coding in C++. In [learn.cpp](learn.cpp), I experimented with functions, types, and other things while learning how C++ works. in [gravity.h](gravity.h) and [gravity.cpp](gravity.cpp), I defined a class `gravity` split across a header document in C and a describing document in C++ to understand how to create classes outside of specific files, so that functions can be reused. 

## Version 1
The first version of my simulation in C++ will simply be able to output the x and y positions accurately in the console based on the forces acting upon velocities.
